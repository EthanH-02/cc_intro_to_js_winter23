# cc_intro_to_js_winter23
Activities and samples to be utilised within the CompClub Intro to JavaScript workshops for Winter 2023.

Please feel free to check through the solutions and explain them to students as they complete the work. However do not directly show them a solution it is for you to make sure you know what is occuring.

Likewise please scale your help to the year level of the student combined with coding experience. Give more obvious hints for year 7 and 8 students then you would a year 11 or 12 student. However never not give a student help, keep trying to find solutions and explanations until they understand the concept.
